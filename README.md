HackSpace is a tool by the Hackers for the Hackers which draws inspiration from [Workana](https://workona.com), [Toby](https://www.gettoby.com/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) - These tools provide workspace like feature for managing tabs in browser and allow for multiple people in a team to collaborate and work on the same project simultaneously, respectively.

We aim to make a similar product which will be **Hackathon/Developer specific**, like a **container** with everything a Hacker needs to successfully collaborate, build, see teammates' progress without glitch. This tool will be available as a **Chrome Extension**, which users can easily download and use.

Tools like Workona and Toby are also not easily accessible and affordable, hence our solution- HACKSPACE

### Features
- It will be easily accessible and available for use as a **Chrome Extension- Developer Tool**. For now our goal is to create a website which will later be available as an extension.
- It is like a **container** consisting of various **tools** like-
   + **Designer Tools** like,
      - Figma, Moqups, Basalmiq, Invision, Axure, OmniGraffle
   + **File sharing tools** like,
      - Dropbox, Google Drive
   + **Planning and Project Management Tools** like,
      - Trello, Plan.io, Kanbanize, Jira
   + **Image editing Tools** like,
      - Photoshop, Gimp, Illustrator, Inkscape, Sketch, Pixelmator
   + **Version Control Tools** like,
      - GitHub, GitLab etc.
   + **Libraries for various frameworks** like, BootStrap, React, Angular etc.
   + Other design tools for **fonts, background, CSS** etc.
   + **Documentation tools** etc.
- User can *create* a workspace for *themselves* or *invite a team*.
- **Workspace creation** involves *selecting above mentioned tools from the section- select tools*.
- This hack workspace for team *will be similar to the working space* of [Canva]() where **multiple people can work on same project**, **use same tools (even add more tools as required), make notes, add comments, add tasks, add other actions like creating a new GitHub Repository, creating a new Pull Request, opening a new Figma JamBoard, opening a new or existing Document and more.**
- These *working spaces can be customised everytime teammates/users want to*, allowing for flexibility and can also be **saved as a template for making projects of similar type in future.**
- Users can **duplicate workspace**.
- Users can make workspaces **private and public** as and when required.
- It offers **lock, hide and deny access features** also, while working in teams.
- At each step users **can share the link of current workspace to other team mates and start working from scratch**.
- In addition to these *distinguishing features*, HackSpace will provide, **Fullscreen mode, Change Theme options, Create new section option and will be availbe with Autosave capability**.
