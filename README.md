HackSpace is a tool by the Hackers for the Hackers which draws inspiration from [Workana](https://workona.com), [Toby](https://www.gettoby.com/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) - These tools provide workspace like feature for managing tabs in browser and allow for multiple people in a team to collaborate and work on the same project simultaneously, respectively.

We aim to make a similar product which will be **Hackathon/Developer specific**, like a **container** with everything a Hacker needs to successfully collaborate, build, see teammates' progress without glitch. This tool will be available as a **Chrome Extension**, which users can easily download and use but for now our goal is to create a website which will later be available as an extension.

Tools like Workona and Toby are also not easily accessible and affordable, hence our solution- HACKSPACE

## Features
- It will be easily accessible and available for use as a **Chrome Extension- Developer Tool**. For now our goal is to create a website which will later be available as an extension.
- It is like a **container** consisting of various **tools** like-
   + **Designer Tools** like,
      - Figma, Moqups, Basalmiq, Invision, Axure, OmniGraffle
   + **File sharing tools** like,
      - Dropbox, Google Drive
   + **Planning and Project Management Tools** like,
      - Trello, Plan.io, Kanbanize, Jira
   + **Image editing Tools** like,
      - Photoshop, Gimp, Illustrator, Inkscape, Sketch, Pixelmator
   + **Version Control Tools** like,
      - GitHub, GitLab etc.
   + **Libraries for various frameworks** like, BootStrap, React, Angular etc.
   + Other design tools for **fonts, background, CSS** etc.
   + **Documentation tools** etc.
- User can *create* a workspace for *themselves* or *invite a team*.
- **Workspace creation** involves *selecting above mentioned tools from the section- select tools*.
- This hack workspace for team *will be similar to the working space* of [Canva]() where **multiple people can work on same project**, **use same tools (even add more tools as required), make notes, add comments, add tasks, add other actions like creating a new GitHub Repository, creating a new Pull Request, opening a new Figma JamBoard, opening a new or existing Document and more.**
- These *working spaces can be customised everytime teammates/users want to*, allowing for flexibility and can also be **saved as a template for making projects of similar type in future.**
- Users can **duplicate workspace**.
- Users can make workspaces **private and public** as and when required.

  ## How we built it
- We built using Front-end Web Development tools like-
     + HTML
     + CSS
     + JavaScript
     + TypeScript
     + TailwindCSS 
     + React
- In the backend we have used **Appwrite** for strong and smooth working.
- In addition to these frameworks, our team came up with a **great design** in the very beginning of the Hackathon using tools like **Figma** and **Canva**

## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the hackathon we felt shortage of time and for a larger part of the hackathon, we had trouble collaborating with each other. We had to always keep in mind to first build the MVP of our project.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Initially we had trouble brainstorming an idea and begin building since, many of our team members were first time hackers. But we were able to come up with an idea early and managed to build the MVP.

## What we learned
The most valuable skill that we learnt is time management, focusing on first building the MVP and collaborating more actively with each other. 

## What's next for HackSpace
- HackSpace needs to made available as a chrome extension for everybody's use.
- We have not been able to implement some of the functionality claimed above, we aim to implement them.
- We aim to add more tools apart from GitHub and Figma for future use.
- We aim to implement auto-save functionality in the future.

- It offers **lock, hide and deny access features** also, while working in teams.
- At each step users **can share the link of current workspace to other team mates and start working from scratch**.
- In addition to these *distinguishing features*, HackSpace will provide, **Fullscreen mode, Change Theme options, Create new section option and will be availbe with Autosave capability**.
